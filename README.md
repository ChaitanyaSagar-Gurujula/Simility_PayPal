Simility Data Challenge:

Provided Dataset belongs to a travel insurance company which needs help in predicting whether customer is going to claim insurance or not.
Xgboost Classifier is implemented with feature engineered dataset.
SMOTE is not used to upsample or balance the dataset as the main purpose of this assignment is to get the patterns from the data.
Also, it would have been more better if actual customer data is included in the dataset.
